Hello There!
=========
- I'm Kemo, a 18 year old programmer who converts any caffeine drink to code or a readable IDA pro pseudo code, primarily uses C++. along with Javascript and a little bit of C# and i am willing to learn rust so soon, i break software and mainly games to mod and make them cooler and more enjoyable. i usually mod fortnite all my spare time and i am planning my last fortnite project this summer before moving ;). if you are interested in more about my skills and projects you can check my [portfolio](https://kemo.dev/).


- I'm not getting paid for anything, Most 90% of my projects are open-source so people can learn from them, we all learnt from others's open source projects ain't we? `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`


- Currently I'm a high school senior, i live in Egypt (where internet is limited and expensive) hence i am looking for a job as i always do everything for free.
